# SodaStream Break-Even Calculator

This web-based calculator helps you determine how many 800ml bottles of soda you need to make with a SodaStream before it becomes more cost-effective than buying bottled soda. The calculator takes into account the cost of the SodaStream machine, CO2 cartridges, syrup mix (sold per 9 liters), and compares it with the cost of buying soda per liter.

## Features

- **User Inputs**: Enter the costs of the SodaStream machine, CO2 cartridges, syrup mix, and the price of bottled soda per liter.
- **Instant Calculation**: Calculates and displays the number of 800ml bottles you need to make for the SodaStream to be more cost-effective.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Easy-to-use web form for inputting your data.
